Bottles RailsApp
======= ========

Since I have become a home brewer and started to hand out beer in bottles to family and friends. I found out quickly that I needed an application to track my progress in brewing recipies and also a place for people who want beer, who have beer, who have returned bottles, and those who have not returned bottles.

This application is setout to accomplish the above mentioned.
